# Mapping Corn, Soybeans and "others"

## Introduction

Understanding the types, quantities, and qualities of agricultural crops grown in a region is crucial for predicting yield, estimating import/export needs, 
and assessing factors like soil organic carbon or greenhouse gas emissions []. 
Government agencies and private companies have attempted to create models for determining crop types grown in a country.
Utilizing remote sensing of agricultural land through publicly available imagery from Earth-observing satellites proves to be a more economical approach compared to 
methods like nationwide surveys or direct field visits. For instance, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) annually produces a Crop Data Layer (CDL) with a
resolution of $30 \times 30 m^2$ for the continental U.S., mapping major and minor agricultural crops, and other land cover types [].

## The Problem 
The CDL is typically released towards the end of January in the following crop calendar, and its production takes approximately 13 months []. 
However, there is a demand for a faster turnaround, and considering that not all countries produce crop maps, this remains a relevant issue.

For our educational project, we simplify the problem by focusing on mapping only three crop classes: Corn, Soybeans, and "other." 
Furthermore, we limit our spatial analysis to Green County, IA.

Here's a satellite base map of the county. Notice the fields, roads, and the river through the middle:

Once our model is deployed, we have the flexibility to experiment with the spatial extent. 
We can test it in a neighboring county where the model was not initially trained, or be more adventurous and evaluate its performance in a different state like Indiana or a southern state.
